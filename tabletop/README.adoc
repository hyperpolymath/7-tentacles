:toc:

*Print-and-Play Card Games Teaching Compiler Concepts*

== Overview

These tabletop games teach the same concepts as the digital Seven Tentacles framework, but without screens! Perfect for:

* Classrooms without reliable technology
* Family game nights
* After-school clubs
* Introduction before digital lessons

== How to Print

1. Open the `cards.html` file in each game folder
2. Click "Print" (or press Ctrl+P)
3. Use cardstock for best results (regular paper works too)
4. Cut out the cards along borders
5. Optional: Laminate for durability

== Materials Needed

* Printer (color preferred, B&W works)
* Paper or cardstock
* Scissors
* Optional: Laminator, card sleeves

== Age Recommendations

* **Ages 6-8:** Use "Junior Mode" variants
* **Ages 8-12:** Standard rules (Cuttle stage)
* **Ages 13+:** Add advanced variants

== The Secret Learning

Each game secretly teaches a compiler concept:

* **Red's Racing:** Valid paths = valid syntax; obstacles = errors; efficiency = optimization
* **Yellow's Sorting:** Types = categories; bins = type constraints; errors = type mismatches
* **Blue's Mystery:** Elimination = proof by contradiction; evidence = assertions; verification = checking

DON'T reveal these connections to younger players! Let them discover it naturally at the Squidlet stage (age 13+).

== Facilitation Tips

1. **Let them play first** - Don't over-explain rules
2. **Ask questions** - "Why did that path not work?"
3. **Connect later** - At age 13+, reveal the CS connections
4. **Celebrate errors** - Mistakes are learning opportunities

== Combining Games

For longer sessions, play multiple games in sequence:

1. Start with **Red** (introduces valid/invalid sequences)
2. Then **Yellow** (adds type categories)
3. Finally **Blue** (combines logic and proof)

This mirrors the Cuttle curriculum progression!

== Future Games (Planned)

* 🟠 **Juggler Orange's Timing Game** - Concurrency/scheduling
* 🟢 **Builder Green's Construction Game** - AST/structure
* 🟣 **Magic Indigo's Spell Cards** - Transformation/macros
* 🟤 **Teacher Violet's Rule Maker** - Governance/fairness
